journey through the past, neil young, song without a home  when the winter rains come pourin' down on that new home of mine will you think of me and wonder if i'm fine? will your restless heart come back to mine on a journey through the past? will i still be in your eyes and on your mind?  now i'm going back to canada on a journey through the past and i won't be back 'til february comes i will stay with you if you'll stay with me said the fiddler to the drum and we'll keep good time on a journey through the past  when the winter rains come pourin' down on that new home of mine will i still be in your eyes and on your mind? will i still be in your eyes and on your mind?
words (between the lines of age), neil young, someone and someone were down by the pond looking for something to plant in the lawn out in the fields they were turning the soil i'm sitting here hoping this water will boil when i look through the windows and out on the road they're bringing me presents and saying hello  singing words words between the lines of age words words between the lines of age   if i was a junkman selling you cars washing your windows and shining your stars thinking your mind was my own in a dream what would you wonder? and how would it seem? living in castles a bit at a time the king started laughing and talking in rhyme  singing words words between the lines of age words words between the lines of age
one of these days, neil young, one of these days i'm going to sit down and write a long letter to all the good friends i've known and i'm going to try and thank them all for the good times together though so apart we've grown one of these days i'm going to sit down and write a long letter to all the good friends i've known one of these days one of these days one of these days and it won't be long it won't be long and i'm going to thank that old country fiddler and all those rough boys who play that rock 'n' roll i never tried to burn any bridges though i know i let some good things go one of these days i'm going to sit down and write a long letter to all the good friends i've known one of these days one of these days one of these days and it won't be long it won't be long from down in l.a all the way to nashville from new york city to my canadian prairie home my friends are scattered like leaves from an old maple some are weak some are strong one of these days i'm going to sit down and write a long letter to all the good friends i've known one of these days one of these days one of these days and it won't be long it won't be long one of these days one of these days one of these days and it won't be long it won't be long
the loner, neil young, he's a perfect stranger like a cross of himself and a fox he's a feeling arranger and a changer of the ways he talks he's the unforeseen danger the keeper of the key to the locks  know when you see him nothing can free him step aside open wide it's the loner  if you see him in the subway he'll be down at the end of the car watching you move until he knows he knows who you are when you get off at your station alone he'll know that you are   there was a woman he knew about a year or so ago she had something that he needed and he pleaded with her not to go on the day that she left he died but it did not show
comes a time, neil young, comes a time when you're drifting comes a time when you settle down comes a light feelings lifting lift that baby right up off the ground  oh this old world keeps spinning round it's a wonder tall trees ain't layin' down there comes a time  you and i we were captured we took our souls and we flew away we were right we were giving that's how we kept what we gave away
