i saw god today, george strait, just walked down the street to the coffee shop~had to take a break~i've been by her side for eighteen hours straight~saw a flower growing in the middle of the sidewalk~pushing up through the concrete~like it was planted right there for me to see~the flashing lights~the honking horns~all seem to fade away~but in the shadow of the hospital~at 508~i saw god today~~i've been to church~i've read the book~i know he's there~but i don't look~near as often as i should~his fingerprints are everywhere~i just look down and stop and stare~open my eyes and then i swear~i saw god today~~saw a couple walking by~they were holding hands~and she had that glow~yeah i couldn't help~but i noticed that she was starting to show~stood there for a minute~taking in the sky~lost in that sunset~a splashing down from mounting in shades of red~~~got my face pushed up against the nursery glass~she's sleeping like a rock~my name on her wrist~wearing tiny pink socks~she's got my nose~she's got her mama's eyes~my brand new baby girl~she's a miracle~i saw god today

when the lights go down, faith hill, when the lights go down~he'll be filling a pan with a broom in his hand~in some dive across town~he'll be wiping the bar and mopping the floor~counting his tips and locking the doors~wrestling the devil that tells him to pour another round~when the lights go down~she'll be calling her friends from her mercedes benz~but it's too late now~they were there for the fame the flash and the thrill~for the drop of the name the parties the pills~as another star falls from the hollywood hills without a sound~~when the lights go down and there's nothing left to be~when the lights go down and the truth is all you see~when you feel that hole inside your soul~and wonder what you're made of~well we all find out~when the lights go down~~when the lights go down~at the end of the day when this game that i play~has gone another round~as i lay there alone on this big empty bed~with nothing but thoughts of you in my head~i think of the things that i wish i had said~when you were still around~~when the lights go down and there's nothing left to be~when the lights go down and the truth is all you see~and i wonder if all my life's about~the sum of all my fears and all my doubts~when the lights go down~when the lights go down and there's nothing left to be~when the lights go down and the truth is all you see~when you feel that hole inside your soul~and wonder what you're made of~well we all find out~when the lights go down~oh when the lights go down

amanda, waylon jennings, i've held it all inward god knows i've tried~but it's an awful awakening in a country boy's life~to look in the mirror in total surprise~at the hair on my shoulders and the age in my eyes~~amanda light of my life~fate should have made you a gentleman's wife~amanda light of my life~fate should have made you a gentleman's wife~~it's a measure of people who don't understand~the pleasures of life in a hillbilly band~i got my first guitar when i was fourteen~well i finally made forty still wearing jeans
bob wills is still the king, waylon jennings, well the honky-tonks in texas were my natural second home~where you tip your hats to the ladies and the rose of san antone~i grew up on music that we called western swing~it don't matter who's in austin bob wills is still the king~~lord i can still remember the way things were back then~in spite of all the hard times i'd live it all again~to hear the texas playboys and tommy duncan sing~makes me proud to be from texas where bob wills is still the king~~you can hear the grand old opry in nashville tennessee~it's the home of country music on that we all agree~but when you cross that old red river hoss that just don't mean a thing~because once you're down in texas bob wills is still the king~~well if you ain't never been there then i guess you ain't been told~that you just can't live in texas unless you got a lot of soul~it's the home of willie nelson the home of western swing~he'll be the first to tell you bob wills is still the king
