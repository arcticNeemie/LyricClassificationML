why she disappeared [poem], taylor swift, when she fell she fell apart.~cracked her bones on the pavement she once decorated~as a child with sidewalk chalk~when she crashed her clothes disintegrated and blew away~with the winds that took all of her fair-weather friends~when she looked around her skin was spattered with ink~forming the words of a thousand voices~echoes she heard even in her sleep:~whatever you say it is not right.~whatever you do it is not enough.~your kindness is fake.~your pain is manipulative.~when she lay there on the ground~she dreamed of time machines and revenge~and a love that was really something~not just the idea of something.~when she finally rose she rose slowly~avoiding old haunts and sidestepping shiny pennies~wary of phone calls and promises~charmers dandies and get-love-quick-schemes~when she stood she stood with a desolate knowingness~waded out into the dark wild ocean up to her neck~bathed in her brokenness~said a prayer of gratitude for each chink in the armor~she never knew she needed~standing broad-shouldered next to her~was a love that was really something~not just the idea of something.~when she turned to go home~she heard the echoes of new words~may your heart remain breakable~but never by the same hand twice~and even louder:~without your past~you could never have arrived-~so wondrously and brutally~by design or some violent exquisite happenstance~...here.~and in the death of her reputation~she felt truly alive.
