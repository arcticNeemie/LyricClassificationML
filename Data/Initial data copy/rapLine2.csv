sing about me i'm dying of thirst, kendrick lamar, when the lights shut off and it's my turn~to settle down my main concern~promise that you will sing about me~promise that you will sing about me~i said when the lights shut off and it's my turn~to settle down my main concern~promise that you will sing about me~promise that you will sing about me~~i woke up this morning and figured i'd call you~in case i'm not here tomorrow~i'm hopin' that i can borrow~a peace of mind i'm behind on what's really important~my mind is really distorted~i find nothing but trouble in my life~i'm fortunate you believe in a dream~this orphanage we call a ghetto is quite a routine~and last night was just another distraction~or a reaction of what we consider madness~i know exactly what happened~you ran outside when you heard my brother cry for help~held him like a newborn baby and made him feel~like everything was alright in a fight he tried to put up~but the type of bullet that stuck~had went against his will that's blood spilled on your hands~my plan's rather vindictive~everybody's a victim in my eyes~when i ride it's a murderous rhythm~and outside became pitch black~a demon glued to my back whispering get 'em!~i got 'em and i ain't give a fuck~that same mentality i told my brother not to duck~in actuality it's a trip how we trip off of colors~i wonder if i'll ever discover a passion like you and recover~the life that i knew as a youngin~in pajamas and dun-ta-duns~when thunder comes it rains cats and dogs~dumb niggas like me never prosper~prognosis of a problem child i'm proud and well-devoted~this piru shit been in me forever~so forever i'ma push it wherever whenever~and i love you 'cause you love my brother like you did~just promise me you'll tell this story when you make it big~and if i die before your album drop i hope— ~~promise that you will sing about me~promise that you will sing about me~i said when the lights shut off and it's my turn~to settle down my main concern~promise that you will sing about me~promise that you will sing about me~~you wrote a song about my sister on your tape~and called it section.80~the message resembled brenda's got a baby~what's crazy was i was hearin' about it~but doubted your ignorance~how could you ever just put her on blast and shit?~judgin' her past and shit?~well it's completely my future~her nigga behind me right now askin' for ass and shit~and i'ma need that forty dollars~even if i got to fuck suck and swallow~in the parking lot gonzales park i'm followed~by a married man and father of three~my titties bounce on the cadence of his tinklin' keys~matter of fact he my favorite 'cause he tip me with e's~he got a cousin named david and i seen him last week~this is the life of another girl damaged by the system~these foster homes i run away and never do miss 'em~see my hormones just run away and if i can get 'em~back to where they used to be then i'll probably be in the denim~of a family gene that show women how to be woman~or better yet a leader you need her to learn somethin'~then you probably need to beat her that's how i was taught~three niggas in one room first time i was tossed~and i'm exhausted but fuck that sorry for your loss shit~my sister died in vain but what point are you tryna gain~if you can't fit the pumps i walk in?~i'll wait… your rebuttal a little too late~and if you have a album date just make sure i'm not in the song~'cause i don't need the attention bring enough of that on my own~and matter fact did i mention that i physically feel great?~a doctor's approval is a waste of time i know i'm straight~i'll probably live longer than you and never fade away~i'll never fade away i'll never fade away i know my fate~and i'm on the grind for this cake i'ma get it or die tryin'~i'm eyein' every male gender with intentions of buyin'~you lyin' to these motherfuckers~talkin' about you can help 'em with my story~you can help me if you sell this pussy for me nigga~don't ignore me nigga fuck your glory nigga you ain't shit~~when the lights shut off and it's my turn~to settle down my main concern~promise that you will sing about me~promise that you will sing about me~i said when the lights shut off and it's my turn~to settle down my main concern~promise that you will sing about me~promise that you will sing about me~~sometimes i look in the mirror~and ask myself: am i really scared of passin' away?~if it's today i hope i hear a~cry out from heaven so loud it can water down a demon~with the holy ghost 'til it drown in the blood of jesus~i wrote some raps that made sure that my lifeline reekin'~the scent of a reaper ensurin' that my allegiance~with the other side may come soon and if i'm doomed~may the womb of my mother be blessed for many moons~i suffer a lot~and every day that glass mirror get tougher to watch~i tie my stomach in knots~and i'm not sure why i'm infatuated with death~my imagination is surely an aggravation of threats~that can come about ’cause the tongue is mighty powerful~and i can name a list of your favorites that probably vouch~maybe 'cause i'm a dreamer and sleep is the cousin of death~really stuck in the schema of wonderin' when i'ma rest~and you're right your brother was a brother to me~and your sister's situation was the one that pulled me~in a direction to speak on somethin'~that's realer than the tv screen~by any means wasn't tryin' to offend or come between~her personal life i was like it need to be told~cursin' the life of twenty generations after her soul~exactly what'd happen if i ain't continue rappin'~or steady bein' distracted by money drugs and 4-5's~i count lives all on these songs~look at the weak and cry pray one day you'll be strong~fightin' for your rights even when you're wrong~and hope that at least one of you sing about me when i'm gone~am i worth it? did i put enough work in?~~promise that you will sing about me~promise that you will sing about me~i said when the lights shut off and it's my turn~to settle down my main concern~promise that you will sing about me~promise that you will sing about me~~promise that you'll sing about me forever~promise that you'll sing about me for— ooooh~promise that you'll sing about me forever~promise that you'll sing about me for— ooooh~promise that you'll sing about me forever~promise that you'll sing about me for— ooooh~~(on the phone)~ay ay ay where you 'bout to go?~nigga the homie's brother-- nigga right here he gone my nigga he gone!~nigga-- they just killed the homie's brother my nigga. we right here on the

a deep depression~found myself screaming in the hotel room~i didn’t wanna self destruct~the evils of lucy was all around me~so i went running for answers~until i came home~but that didn’t stop survivor’s guilt~going back and forth trying to convince myself the stripes i earned~or maybe how a-1 my foundation was~but while my loved ones was fighting the continuous war back in the city~i was entering a new one~a war that was based on apartheid and discrimination~made me wanna go back to the city and tell the homies what i learned~the word was respect~just because you wore a different gang color than mine's~doesn’t mean i can’t respect you as a black man~forgetting all the pain and hurt we caused each other in these streets~if i respect you we unify and stop the enemy from killing us~but i don’t know i’m no mortal man~maybe i’m just another nigga”~shit and that’s all i wrote~i was gonna call it another nigga but it ain’t really a poem~i just felt like it’s something you probably could relate to~other than that now that i finally got a chance to holla at you~i always wanted to ask you about a certain situa-~about a metaphor actually uh you spoke on the ground~what you mean by that what the ground represent?~the ground is gonna open up and swallow the evil~right~that’s how i see it my word is bond~i see—and the ground is the symbol for the poor people~right~the poor people is gonna open up this whole world~and swallow up the rich people~'cause the rich people gonna be so fat~and they gonna be so appetizing you know what i’m saying wealthy appetizing~the poor gonna be so poor and hungry~right~you know what i’m saying it’s gonna be like~you know what i'm saying it's gonna be...~there might there might be some cannibalism out this muh-fu-~they might eat the rich you know what i'm saying?~aight so let me ask you this then~do you see yourself as somebody that’s rich~or somebody that made the best of they own opportunities?~i see myself as a natural born hustler~a true hustler in every sense of the word~i took nothin’ i took the opportunities~i worked at the most menial and degrading job~and built myself up so i could get it to where i owned it~i went from having somebody managing me~to me hiring the person that works my management company~i changed everything i realized my destiny~in a matter of five years you know what i’m saying?~i made myself a millionaire i made millions for a lot of people~now it’s time to make millions for myself you know what i’m saying?~i made millions for the record companies~i made millions for these movie companies~now i make millions for for us~and through your different avenues of success~how would you say you managed to keep a level of sanity?~by my faith in god by my faith in the game~and by my faith in all good things come to those that stay true~right~you know what i’m saying?~and it was happening to me for a reason~you know what i’m saying i was noticing shit~i was punching the right buttons and it was happening~so it’s no problem you know~i mean it’s a problem but i’m not finna let them know~i’m finna go straight through~would you consider yourself a fighter at heart or somebody that~somebody that only reacts when they back is against the wall?~shit i like to think that at every opportunity i’ve ever been uh threatened with resistance it’s been met with resistance~and not only me but it goes down my family tree~you know what i’m saying it’s in my veins to fight back~aight well how long will you think it take before niggas be like~we fighting a war i’m fighting a war i can’t win~and i wanna lay it all down~in this country a black man only have like~5 years we can exhibit maximum strength~and that’s right now while you a teenager while you still strong~while you still wanna lift weights while you still wanna shoot back~'cause once you turn 30 it’s like~they take the heart and soul out of a man~out of a black man in this country~and you don’t wanna fight no more~and if you don’t believe me you can look around~you don’t see no loud mouth 30-year old motherfuckers~that’s crazy because me being one of your offsprings~of the legacy you left behind i can truly tell you that~there’s nothing but turmoil goin’ on so i wanted to ask you~what you think is the future for me and my generation today?~i think that niggas is tired of grabbin' shit out the stores~and next time it's a riot it's gonna be like uh bloodshed~for real i don’t think america know that~i think america think we was just playing~and it’s gonna be some more playing but~it ain’t gonna be no playing~it’s gonna be murder you know what i’m saying?~it’s gonna be like nat turner 1831 up in this motherfucker~you know what i’m saying it’s gonna happen~that’s crazy man in my opinion~only hope that we kinda have left is music and vibrations~lot a people don’t understand how important it is you know~sometimes i can like get behind a mic~and i don’t know what type of energy i’ma push out~or where it comes from trip me out sometimes~because it's spirits we ain’t even really rappin’~we just letting our dead homies tell stories for us~damn~i wanted to read one last thing to you~it’s actually something a good friend had wrote~describing my world it says:~“the caterpillar is a prisoner to the streets that conceived it~its only job is to eat or consume everything around it~in order to protect itself from this mad city~while consuming its environment~the caterpillar begins to notice ways to survive~one thing it noticed is how much the world shuns him~but praises the butterfly~the butterfly represents the talent the thoughtfulness~and the beauty within the caterpillar~but having a harsh outlook on life~the caterpillar sees the butterfly as weak~and figures out a way to pimp it to his own benefits~already surrounded by this mad city~the caterpillar goes to work on the cocoon~which institutionalizes him~he can no longer see past his own thoughts~he’s trapped~when trapped inside these walls certain ideas take root such as~going home and bringing back new concepts to this mad city~the result?~wings begin to emerge breaking the cycle of feeling stagnant~finally free the butterfly sheds light on situations~that the caterpillar never considered ending the internal struggle~although the butterfly and caterpillar are completely different~they are one and the same~what’s your perspective on that?~pac? pac? pac?!

pound cake  paris morton music 2, drake, good god almighty—like back in the old days...~you know years ago they had the a&r men to tell you what to play how to play it and you know whether it's disco and rock but we just went in the studio and we did it. we had the champagne in the studio of course—compliments of the company—and we just laid back and did it. so we hope you enjoy listening to this album half as much as we enjoyed playing it for you. because we had a ball. only real music is gonna last—all the other bullshit is here today and gone tomorrow...~~cash rules everything around me frikki-frikki-frik~c.r.e.a.m.;

4 your eyez only, j. cole, yeah (for your eyes)~for your eyes only (for your eyes)~for your eyes only for your eyes only~(for your eyes for your eyes)~for your eyes only~~hey niggas be dying on the daily~it seems my dreams faded for far too long~the consequences deadly~can't visualize myself as nothing but a criminal~control the block serving up rocks and stay subliminal~'cause young niggas is hardheaded they letting off~full of adrenaline ignorant to what death can cause~ain't no coming back family dressed in black~plus it's hot now the cops outside it's hard to flip a pack~and my daughter gotta eat her mama be stressing me~like i ain't the one who put them jays on her feet~like i ain't out in the field like that~i might be low for the moment but i will bounce back~despite the charges back to the wall i fight regardless~screaming fuck the law my life is lawless~that's what you call it ain't got to be no psychic~to see this is like the farthest thing from heaven~this is hell and i don't mean that hyperbolic~i try to find employment even if it's wiping toilets~but these felonies be making life the hardest~resisting the temptation to run up and swipe a wallet~or run up on your yard snatch your daughter bike and pawn it~that's why i write this sonnet~if the pressure get too much for me to take and i break~play this tape for my daughter and let her know my life is on it~(for your eyes) let her know my life is on it~(for your eyes) for your eyes only~~for your eyes do you understand?~for your eyes do you understand me?~for your eyes do you understand?~for your eyes do you understand me?~for your eyes do you understand?~for your eyes do you understand me?~for your eyes do you understand?~for your eyes only~~you probably grown now so this song'll hit you~if you hearing this unfortunately means~that i'm no longer with you in the physical~not even sure if i believe in god but because you still alive~he got me praying that the spiritual is real~so i can be a part of you still my pops was killed too~so i know how part of you feels~maybe you hate me maybe you miss me maybe you spite me~life goes in cycles maybe you'll date a nigga just like me~i hope not i'm tired of dope spots~and fiends that smoke rocks~i've seen far too many niggas' hopes rot~i'm writing this because me and the devil had a dance~now i see death around the corner 'pologizing in advance~don't know if i ever had a chance~at a glance i'm a failure~addicted to pushing paraphernalia~but daddy had dreams once my eyes had a gleam once~innocence disappeared by the age of eight years~my pops shot up drug-related mama addicted~so granny raised me in projects where thugs was hanging~blood was staining the concrete~older niggas i loved talked like they was above~maintaining a timesheet that's slow money~picked up the family business by the age of 13~six years later was handed sentence~'round the same time is when you came in this world~me and your mama thinking:~what the fuck we naming this girl?~i told her nina the prettiest name that i could think of~for the prettiest thing my eyes had ever seen i was 19~took me two felonies to see the trap~this crooked-ass system set for me~and now i fear it's too late for me to ever be~the one that set examples that was never set for me~i'm living fast but not fast enough~'cause karma keeps on catching up to me~and if my past becomes the death of me~i hope you understand~~for your eyes do you understand?~for your eyes do you understand me?~for your eyes do you understand?~for your eyes do you understand me?~for your eyes do you understand?~for your eyes do you understand me?~for your eyes do you understand?~for your eyes only~~it's several ways i could've went out too many to count~was it the trigger happy crackers that the badges give clout?~was it the young niggas blasting frustrated~'cause the cash running out?~niggas don't know how to act in a drought~see baby girl i realized~my definition of a real nigga was skewed~my views misshaped by new mixtapes~that confirmed the shit i learned in the streets was true~that real niggas don't speak when they beef with you~they just pull up on your street let the heat achoo~and if a real nigga hungry he gon' eat your food~i was a fool spent all my time ducking school ducking cops~ducking rules hugging blocks that don't love you~i pray you find a nigga with goals and point of views~much broader than the corner if not it's gon' corner you~into a box where your son don't even know his pops~and the cyclical nature of doing time continues~my worst fear is one day that you come home from school~and see your father face while hearing 'bout tragedy on news~i got the strangest feeling your daddy gonna lose his life soon~and sadly if you're listening now it must mean it's true~but maybe there's a chance that it's not~and this album remains locked~in a hard drive like valuable jewels~and i can teach you this in person~like i'm teaching you to tie your own shoes~i love you and i hope to god i don't lose you~for your eyes only~~for your eyes for your eyes only~for your eyes for your eyes only~for your eyes do you understand?~for your eyes only~~one day your daddy called me told me he had a funny feeling~what he'd been dealing with lately he wasn't telling~i tried to pick his brains still he wasn't revealing~but i could feel the sense of panic in his voice~and it was chilling he said:~jermaine i knew you since we was children~i never asked for nothing when times was hard~i never had discussions with you begging you to help me~i dealt with the repercussions of my actions~i know you tried to steer me 'way from that shit~but that shit was in my blood you know my life~i know your momma nigga send my love~in case i never get a chance to speak again~i won't forget the weekends spent sleeping at your crib~that's the way i wished my family lived~but my granny crib was in the 'jects~i had to interject like:~nigga what you talking 'bout? fuck is you getting at?~he said listen i got no time to dive into descriptions~but i been having premonitions~just call it visions from the other side~i got a feeling i won't see tomorrow~like the time i'm living on is borrowed~with that said the only thing i'm proud to say i was a father~write my story down and if i pass~go play it for my daughter when she ready~and so i'm leaving you this record for your eyes only~don't you ever scratch or disrespect it~this perspective is a real one another lost 'ville son~i dedicate these words to you and all the other children~affected by the mass incarceration in this nation~that sent your pops to prison when he needed education~sometimes i think that segregation would've done us better~although i know that means that i would never~be brought into this world 'cause my daddy was so thrilled~when he found him a white girl to take back to jonesboro~with lil' zach and cole world barely one years old~now it's 30 years later making sure this story's told~girl your daddy was a real nigga not 'cause he was cold~not because he was the first~to get some pussy 12 years old~not because he used to come through~in the caddy on some vogues~not because he went from bagging up~them grams to serving o's~nah your daddy was a real nigga not 'cause he was hard~not because he lived a life of crime and sat behind some bars~not because he screamed fuck the law~although that was true~your daddy was a real nigga 'cause he loved you~for your eyes only
