why she disappeared [poem], taylor swift, when she fell she fell apart. cracked her bones on the pavement she once decorated as a child with sidewalk chalk when she crashed her clothes disintegrated and blew away with the winds that took all of her fair-weather friends when she looked around her skin was spattered with ink forming the words of a thousand voices echoes she heard even in her sleep: whatever you say it is not right. whatever you do it is not enough. your kindness is fake. your pain is manipulative. when she lay there on the ground she dreamed of time machines and revenge and a love that was really something not just the idea of something. when she finally rose she rose slowly avoiding old haunts and sidestepping shiny pennies wary of phone calls and promises charmers dandies and get-love-quick-schemes when she stood she stood with a desolate knowingness waded out into the dark wild ocean up to her neck bathed in her brokenness said a prayer of gratitude for each chink in the armor she never knew she needed standing broad-shouldered next to her was a love that was really something not just the idea of something. when she turned to go home she heard the echoes of new words may your heart remain breakable but never by the same hand twice and even louder: without your past you could never have arrived- so wondrously and brutally by design or some violent exquisite happenstance ...here. and in the death of her reputation she felt truly alive.

reputation [prologue], taylor swift, here's something i've learned about people. we think we know someone but the truth is that we only know the version of them they have chosen to show us. we know our friend in a certain light but we don't know them the way their lover does. just the way their lover will never know them the same way that you do as their friend. their mother knows them differently than their roommate who knows them differently than their colleague. their secret admirer looks at them and sees an elaborate sunset of brilliant color and dimension and spirit and pricelessness. and yet a stranger will pass that person and see a faceless member of the crowd nothing more. we may hear rumors about a person and believe those things to be true. we may one day meet that person and feel foolish for believing baseless gossip. this is the first generation that will be able to look back on their entire life story documented in pictures on the internet and together we will all discover the after-effects of that. ultimately we post photos online to curate what strangers think of us. but then we wake up look in the mirror at our faces and see the cracks and scars and blemishes and cringe. we hope someday we'll meet someone who will see that same morning face and instead see their future their partner their forever. someone who will still choose us even when they see all of the sides of the story all the angles of the kaleidoscope that is you. the point being despite our need to simplify and generalize absolutely everyone and everything in this life humans are intrinsically impossible to simplify. we are never just good or just bad. we are mosaics of our worst selves and our best selves our deepest secrets and our favorite stories to tell at a dinner party existing somewhere between our well-lit profile photo and our drivers license shot. we are all a mixture of our selfishness and generosity loyalty and self-preservation pragmatism and impulsiveness. i've been in the public eye since i was 15 years old. on the beautiful lovely side of that i've been so lucky to make music for living and look out into crowds of loving vibrant people. on the other side of the coin my mistakes have been used against me my heartbreaks have been used as entertainment and my songwriting has been trivialized as 'oversharing'. when this album comes out gossip blogs will scour the lyrics for the men they can attribute to each song as if the inspiration for music is as simple and basic as a paternity test. there will be slideshows of photos backing up each incorrect theory because it's 2017 and if you didn't see a picture of it it couldn't have happened right? let me say it again louder for those in the back... we think we know someone but the truth is that we only know the version of them that they have chosen to show us. there will be no further explanation. there will be just reputation.

take it back, ed sheeran, i'm not a rapper i'm a singer with a flow i've got a habit for spitting quicker lyrics you know you'll find me ripping the writtens out of the pages they sit in i never want to get bitten cause plagiarism is hidden watch how i sit on the rhythm prisoner with the vision signed to a label but didn't listen to any criticism thought you knew but you didn't so perk your ears up and listen the studio is a system and you could say that i'm driven and now it's onto the next saga we drink the best lager i'll never try to win you over like your stepfather i'll do my own thing now and get respect after and i'm avoiding the 'caine like it was get carter for four years i never had a place to stay but it's safe to say that it kept me grounded like a paperweight at 16 years old yeah i moved out of my home i was macy gray i tried to say goodbye and i choked and went from sleeping at a subway station to sleeping with a movie star and adding to the population not my imagination i don't wanna relax would it hurt your reputation if i put it on wax? i'll take it back now  mmm come on and take it back love come on and take it back for us don't you fade into the back love oh  i take it back with the rhythm and blues with my rap pack i'll be singing the news tryna act like jack black when i bring it to school i'll make a beat with my feet by just hitting a loop bringing the lyrics to prove that i can fit in these shoes i'll give you the truth through the vocal booth and stars burst out on the scene like an opal fruit they try to take aim like beckham when he goes to shoot but then again that's what they're supposed to do and i'm supposed to be calm i tattooed the lyrics onto my arm whispering everything that happens is from now on i'll be ready to start again by the end of the song and still they're claiming that i handle it wrong but then i've never had an enemy except the nme but i'll be selling twice as many copies as their magazines'll ever be with all these spectacles ahead of me and festival fees are healthier than a dalmatian on pedigree singing for the masses rubber dinghy rapids i keep this rapping a habit and keep on fashioning magic i'm battling for respect and i don't know if i'll have it this song's from the heart covered the planet i'll take it back now  mmm come on and take it back love come on and take it back for us don't you fade into the back love oh  now i don't ever wanna be perfect cause i'm a singer that you never wanna see shirtless and i accept the fact that someone's gotta win worst-dressed taking my first steps into the scene giving me focus putting on a brave face like timothy dalton considering a name change thinking it was hopeless rhyming over recordings avoiding tradition cause every day some lyrics and a melody could be written now absence can make your heart ache but drinking absinthe can change your mind state vividly need to let my liver be and i'll say it again living life on the edge with a closed handful of friends it's good advice from the man who took his life on the road with me and i hope to see him blowing up globally cause that's how it's supposed to be i'm screaming out vocally it might seem totally impossible achieving life's dreams but but i just write schemes i'm never having a stylist giving me tight jeans madison square garden is where i might be but more likely you'll find me in the back room of a dive bar with my mates having a pint with mcdaid discussing records we made and every single second knowing that we'll never betray the way we were raised remembering our background sat down that's how we plan it out it's time to take it back now  mmm come on and take it back love come on and take it back for us don't you fade into the back love oh  mmm come on and take it back love come on and take it back for us don't you fade into the back love oh  my dreams keep me awake at night written in rhyme till i deliver the hype am i just living a lie? with this you must know that the numbers just sold will keep me going through the tough times dream with me we forget ninety percent of it when we wake but the other ten percent it never fades dreaming dreams of day-to-day goals stay awake loads tried to make the cut like the paper with a razor blade oh never give up just remember just to hold out more a couple years ago i couldn't just control that thought you'd find me busking on the street when it was cold outdoors now i'm sweating on the stage of a sold-out tour writing love songs for the sake of it never to make a hit you can't fake talent and work ethic just to make it quick i'm not a rapper i'm a singer i just take the piss and most of these other guys are kids that pose his little sister has to babysit that's just the way it is dreams are your own just set your goals and have the upmost faith in it tread your own path you'll never make it as a follower you'll never know where you will go or you will be tomorrow igh!
u.n.i., ed sheeran, i found your hairband on my bedroom floor the only evidence that you've been here before and i don't get waves of missing you anymore they're more like tsunami tides in my eyes never getting dry so i get high smoke away the days never sleep with the light on weeks pass in the blink of an eye and i'm still drunk at the end of the night i don't drink like everybody else i do it to forget things about myself stumble and fall with head spin i've got my mind's with you but my heart's just not  so am i close to you anymore if it's over and there's no chance that we'll work it out?  that's why you and i ended over u-n-i and i said that's fine but you're the only one that knows i lied you and i ended over u-n-i and i said that's fine but you're the only one that knows i lied  everybody said we'd be together forever but i know that i never wanna settle down come around break up the love like lego now never wanna turn into another like you sleep with my thoughts dance with my views everything’s great not everything’s sure but you live in your halls and i live in a tour bus now i'm in position to be another stalker like every thing i say seems to always sound awkward like our last kiss it was perfect we were nervous on the surface and i'm always saying everyday that it was worth it pain is only relevant if it still hurts i forget like an elephant or we can use a sedative and go back to the day we fell in love just on our first kiss  so am i close to you anymore if it's over and there's no chance that we'll work it out?  oh you and i ended over u-n-i and i said that's fine but you're the only one that knows i lied you and i ended over u-n-i and i said that's fine but you're the only one that knows i lied  because if i was gonna go somewhere i'd be there by now and maybe i can let myself down (wo-oahh) and thinking i am unaware i keep my feet on the ground keep looking around to make sure i'm not the only one to feel low because if you want i'll take you in my arms and keep you sheltered from all that i've done wrong and i'll know you'll say that i'm the only one but i know god made another one of me to love you better than i ever will  'cause you and i ended over u-n-i and i said that's fine but you're the only one that knows i lied you and i ended over u-n-i and i said that's fine but you're the only one that knows i lied
nina, ed sheeran, i met you when i was a teen but then you were one as well and i could play a guitar just like ringing a bell sometimes i wonder in any other summer could you have been my part time lover to me listening to stevie wonder? under the covers where we used to lay and re: stacks is what the speakers played i'd be on tour almost every day when i was home up in my flat is where we used to stay just watching a dvd smoking illegal weed getting high as two kites when we needed to breathe we used each other's air just for the people to see and stay up all night like when we needed to sleep we go anywhere our minds would take us and i'll say you are beautiful without your make-up and you don’t even need to worry about your weight cause we can all be loved the way that god made us and time's the only reason that we could break up cause you would always tell me i'm away too much distance is relative to the time that it takes to get on a plane or make a mistake so say it again  oh nina you should go nina cause i ain't never coming home nina oh won't you leave me now? and i've been living on the road nina but then again you should know nina cause that’s you and me both nina oh won't you leave me now now?  and every weekend in the winter you'd be wearing my hoodie with drawstrings pulled tight to keep your face from the cold taking day trips to the local where we'd eat on our own cause every day when i was away we'd only speak on the phone watching blue planet creating new habits acting as if we were two rabbits and then you'd vanish back to the burrow with all the celtics i disappear you call me selfish i understand but i can’t help it i put my job over everything except my family and friends but you'll be in between forever so i guess we'll have to take a step back overlook the situation cause mixing business and feelings will only lead to complications and i'm not saying we should be taking a break just re-evaluate quick before we make a mistake and it’s too late so we can either deal with the pain or wait to get on a plane but in a day we'll have to say it again  oh nina you should go nina cause i ain't never coming home nina oh won't you leave me now? and i've been living on the road nina but then again you should know nina cause that’s you and me both nina oh won't you leave me now now?  love will come and love will go but you can't make it on your own sing that song go oh won't you leave me now? people grow and fall apart but you can't mend your broken heart take it back go oh won't you leave me now?  oh nina you should go nina (love will come and love will go) cause i ain't never coming home nina (but you can make it on your own) oh won't you leave me now? (sing that song go oh won't you leave me now) and i've been living on the road nina (people grow and fall apart) but then again you should know nina (but you can mend your broken heart) cause that’s you and me both nina (take it back go oh won't you leave me now) oh won't you leave me now now? oh nina you should go nina (love will come and love will go) cause i ain't never coming home nina (but you can make it on your own) oh won't you leave me now? (sing that song go oh won't you leave me now) and i've been living on the road nina (people grow and fall apart) but then again you should know nina (but you can mend your broken heart) cause that’s you and me both nina oh won't you leave me now now?
wake me up, ed sheeran, i should ink my skin with your name and take my passport out again and just replace it see i could do without a tan on my left hand where my fourth finger meets my knuckle and i should run you a hot bath fill it up with bubbles 'cause maybe you're loveable maybe you're my snowflake and your eyes turn from green to gray and in the winter i'll hold you in a cold place and you should never cut your hair 'cause i love the way you flick it off your shoulder  and you will never know just how beautiful you are to me but maybe i'm just in love when you wake me up  and would you ever feel guilty if you did the same to me could you make me a cup of tea to open my eyes in the right way and i know you love shrek 'cause we've watched it 12 times and maybe you're hoping for a fairy-tale too and if your dvd breaks today you should've got a vcr because i've never owned a blu-ray true say i know i've always been shit at computer games and your brother always beats me and if i lost i go across and chuck all the controllers at the tv and then you laugh at me and be asking me if i'm gonna be home next week and then you lie with me 'til i fall asleep and flutter eye lash on my cheek between the sheets  and you will never know just how beautiful you are to me but maybe i'm just in love when you wake me up  and i think you hate the smell of smoke you always try and get me to stop but you drink as much as me and i get drunk a lot so i’ll take you to the beach and walk along the sand and i'll make you a heart pendant with a pebble held in my hand and i'll carve it like this necklace so the heart falls where your chest is now a piece of me is a piece of the beach and it falls just where it needs to be and rests peacefully so you just need to breathe to feel my heart against yours now against yours now cos maybe i'm just in love when you wake me up or maybe i'm just in love when you wake me up maybe i fell in love when you woke me up
small bump, ed sheeran, you're just a small bump unborn in four months you're brought to life you might be left with my hair but you'll have your mother's eyes i'll hold your body in my hands be as gentle as i can but for now you're a scan of my unmade plans a small bump in four months you're brought to life  i'll whisper quietly i'll give you nothing but truth if you're not inside me i'll put my future in you  you are my one and only and you can wrap your fingers 'round my thumb and hold me tight oh you are my one and only you can wrap your fingers 'round my thumb and hold me tight and you'll be all right  you're just a small bump unknown you'll grow into your skin with a smile like hers and a dimple beneath your chin finger nails the size of a half grain of rice and eyelids closed to be soon opened wide a small bump in four months you'll open your eyes  and i'll hold you tightly i'll tell you nothing but truth if you're not inside me i'll put my future in you  you are my one and only and you can wrap your fingers round my thumb and hold me tight oh you are my one and only you can wrap your fingers round my thumb and hold me tight and you'll be all right  you can lie with me with your tiny feet when you're half asleep i'll leave you be right in front of me for a couple weeks so i can keep you safe  'cause you are my one and only you can wrap your fingers round my thumb and hold me tight you are my one and only you can wrap your fingers round my thumb and hold me tight and you'll be all right  you were just a small bump unborn just four months then torn from life maybe you were needed up there but we're still unaware as why
the man, ed sheeran, now i don't wanna hate you just wish you'd never gone for the man and waited two weeks at least before you let him take you i stayed true i kind of knew you liked the dude from private school he's waiting for the time to move i knew he had his eyes on you he's not the right guy for you don't hate me 'cause i write the truth no i would never lie to you but it was never fine to lose you and what a way to find out it never came from my mouth you never changed your mind but you were just afraid to mind out but  it i won't be changing the subject i love it i'll make your little secret public it's nothing i'm just disgusted with the skeletons you sleep with in your closet to get back at me trapped and i'm lacking sleep fact is you're mad at me because i backtrack so casually you're practically my family if we married then i'll guess you'd have to be but tragically our love just lost the will to live but would i kill to give it one more shot? i think not  i don't love you baby i don't need you baby i don't want you no anymore i don't love you baby i don't need you baby i don't wanna love you no anymore  recently i tend to zone out up in my headphones to holocene you promised your body but i'm away so much i stay more celibate than in a monastery i'm not cut out for life on the road 'cause i didn't know i'd miss you this much and at the time we'd just go so sue me i guess i'm not the man that you need ever since you went to uni i've been sofa surfing with a rucksack full of less cash and i guess that could get bad but when i broke the industry that's when i broke your heart i was supposed to chart and celebrate but good things are over fast i know it's hard to deal with and see this i tend to turn you off and switch on my professional features then i turn the music off and all i'm left with is to pick up my personal pieces jesus i never really want to believe this got advice from my dad and he told me that family is all i'll ever have and need i guess i'm unaware of it success is nothing if you have no one there left to share it with  i don't love you baby i don't need you baby i don't want you no anymore i don't love you baby i don't need you baby i don't wanna love you no anymore  and since you left i've given up my days off it's what i need to stay strong i know you have a day job but mine is 24/7 i feel like writing a book i guess i lied in the hook 'cause i still love you and i need you by my side if i could the irony is if my career in music didn't exist in 6 years yeah you'd probably be my wife with a kid i'm frightened to think if i depend on cider and drink and lighting a spliff i fall into a spiral and it's just hiding my misguiding thoughts that i'm trying to kill and i'd be writing my will before i'm 27 i'll die from a thrill go down in history as just a wasted talent can i face the challenge or did i make a mistake erasing ? it's only therapy my thoughts just get ahead of me eventually i'll be fine i know that it was never meant to be either way i guess i'm not prepared but i'll say this these things happen for a reason and you can't change  take my apology i'm sorry for the honesty but i had to get this off my chest  i don't love you baby i don't need you baby i don't want you no anymore i don't love you baby i don't need you baby i don't wanna love you no anymore
all of the stars, ed sheeran, it's just another night and i'm staring at the moon i saw a shooting star and thought of you i sang a lullaby by the waterside and knew if you were here i'd sing to you you're on the other side as the skyline splits in two i'm miles away from seeing you but i can see the stars from america i wondered do you see them too?  so open your eyes and see the way our horizons meet and all of the lights will lead into the night with me and i know these scars will bleed but both of our hearts believe all of these stars will guide us home  i can hear your heart on the radio beat they're playing chasing cars and i thought of us back to the time you were lying next to me i looked across and fell in love so i took your hand back through lamp lit streets i knew everything led back to you so can you see the stars over amsterdam? you're the song my heart is beating to  so open your eyes and see the way our horizons meet and all of the lights will lead into the night with me and i know these scars will bleed but both of our hearts believe all of these stars will guide us home  and oh i know and oh i know and oh i can see the stars from america

malibu, miley cyrus, i never came to the beach or stood by the ocean i never sat by the shore under the sun with my feet in the sand but you brought me here and i'm happy that you did 'cause now i'm as free as birds catchin' the wind i always thought i would sink so i never swam i never went boatin' don't get how they are floatin' and sometimes i get so scared of what i can't understand  but here i am next to you the sky's more blue in malibu next to you in malibu next to you  we watched the sun go down as we were walkin' i'd spent the rest of my life just standing here talkin' you would explain the current as i just smile hoping that you'll stay the same and nothing will change and it'll be us just for a while do they even exist? that's when i make a wish to swim away with the fish cause it's supposed to be this hot all summer long i never would've believed you if three years ago you told me i'd be here writing this song  but here i am next to you the sky's so blue in malibu next to you in malibu next to you next to you the sky's so blue in malibu next to you  we are just like the waves that flow back and forth sometimes i feel like i'm drowning and you're there to save me and i wanna thank you with all of my heart it's a brand new start a dream come true in malibu
