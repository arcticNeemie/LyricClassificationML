that summer, garth brooks, i went to work for her that summer a teenage kid so far from home she was a lonely widow woman hell-bent to make it on her own we were a thousand miles from nowhere wheat fields as far as i could see both needing somethin' from each other not knowin' yet what that might be  'til she came to me one evenin' hot cup of coffee and a smile in a dress that i was certain she hadn't worn in quite a while there was a difference in her laughter there was a softness in her eyes and on the air there was a hunger even a boy could recognize  she had a need to feel the thunder to chase the lightnin' from the sky to watch a storm with all its wonder ragin' in her lover's eyes she had to ride the heat of passion like a comet burnin' bright rushin' headlong in the wind out where only dreams have been burnin' both ends of the night  that summer wind was all around me nothin' between us but the night and when i told her that i'd never she softly whispered that's alright and then i watched her hands of leather turn to velvet in a touch there's never been another summer when i have ever learned so much  we had a need to feel the thunder to chase the lightnin' from the sky to watch a storm with all its wonder ragin' in each others eyes we had to ride the heat of passion like a comet burnin' bright rushin' headlong in the wind out where only dreams have been burnin' both ends of the night  i often think about that summer the sweat the moonlight and the lace and i have rarely held another when i haven't seen her face and every time i pass a wheat field and watch it dancin' with the wind although i know it isn't real i just can't help but feel her hungry arms again  she had a need to feel the thunder to chase the lightnin' from the sky to watch a storm with all its wonder ragin' in her lover's eyes she had to ride the heat of passion like a comet burnin' bright rushin' headlong in the wind out where only dreams have been burnin' both ends of the night  rushin' headlong in the wind out where only dreams have been burnin' both ends of the night

unanswered prayers, garth brooks, just the other night at a hometown football game my wife and i ran into my old high school flame and as i introduced them the past came back to me and i couldn't help but think of the way things used to be  she was the one that i'd wanted for all times and each night i'd spend prayin' that god would make her mine and if he'd only grant me this wish i wished back then i'd never ask for anything again  sometimes i thank god for unanswered prayers remember when you're talkin' to the man upstairs and just because he doesn't answer doesn't mean he don't care some of god's greatest gifts are unanswered prayers  she wasn't quite the angel that i remembered in my dreams and i could tell that time had changed me in her eyes too it seemed we tried to talk about the old days there wasn't much we could recall i guess the lord knows what he's doin' after all  and as she walked away well i looked at my wife and then and there i thanked the good lord for the gifts in my life  sometimes i thank god for unanswered prayers remember when you're talkin' to the man upstairs and just because he may not answer doesn't mean he don't care some of god's greatest gifts are unanswered... some of god's greatest gifts are all too often unanswered... some of god's greatest gifts are unanswered prayers
if tomorrow never comes, garth brooks, sometimes late at night i lie awake and watch her sleeping she's lost in peaceful dreams so i turn out the lights and lay there in the dark and the thought crosses my mind if i never wake up in the morning would she ever doubt the way i feel about her in my heart?  if tomorrow never comes will she know how much i loved her? did i try in every way to show her every day that she's my only one? and if my time on earth were through and she must face the world without me is the love i gave her in the past gonna be enough to last if tomorrow never comes?  'cause i've lost loved ones in my life who never knew how much i loved them now i live with the regret that my true feelings for them never were revealed so i made a promise to myself to say each day how much she means to me and avoid that circumstance where there's no second chance to tell her how i feel  'cause if tomorrow never comes will she know how much i loved her? did i try in every way to show her every day that she's my only one? and if my time on earth were through and she must face the world without me is the love i gave her in the past gonna be enough to last if tomorrow never comes?  so tell that someone that you love just what you're thinkin' of if tomorrow never comes
whiskey to wine, garth brooks, yeah she's nice yeah she's pretty and she's crazy about me she's what every man's hoping to find she's always a lady and that's driving me crazy 'cause after you it's like going from whiskey to wine  whiskey to wine it's just not the same high i miss the fire the burning desire we fought like we loved and we loved all the time we're no good together but it's sure as hell better than going forever from whiskey to wine  when i talk he listens he don't show up missing he's patient polite and refined he's handsome romantic but the problem is damn it that after you it's like going from whiskey to wine  whiskey to wine it's just not the same high i miss the fire the burning desire we fought like we loved and we loved all the time we're no good together but it's sure as hell better than going forever from whiskey to wine it's probably best we rejoin the rest and try to have what they call a good time and hope it's not showing we're walking in knowing that we're going from whiskey to wine

belleau wood, garth brooks, oh the snowflakes fell in silence over belleau wood that night for a christmas truce had been declared by both sides of the fight as we lay there in our trenches the silence broke in two by a german soldier singing a song that we all knew  though i did not know the language the song was silent night then i heard my buddy whisper all is calm and all is bright then the fear and doubt surrounded me because i'd die if i was wrong but i stood up in my trench and i began to sing along  then across the frozen battlefield another's voice joined in until one by one each man became a singer of the hymn  then i thought that i was dreaming for right there in my sight stood the german soldier 'neath the falling flakes of white and he raised his hand and smiled at me as if he seemed to say here's hoping we both live to see us find a better way  then the devil's clock struck midnight and the skies lit up again and the battlefield where heaven stood was blown to hell again but for just one fleeting moment the answer seemed so clear heaven's not beyond the clouds it's just beyond the fear  no heaven's not beyond the clouds it's for us to find it here
