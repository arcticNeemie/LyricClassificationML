in the end, linkin park, it starts with one one thing i don't know why it doesn't even matter how hard you try keep that in mind i designed this rhyme to explain in due time all i know time is a valuable thing watch it fly by as the pendulum swings watch it count down to the end of the day the clock ticks life away it's so unreal you didn't look out below watch the time go right out the window tryin' to hold on didn't even know i wasted it all just to watch you go i kept everything inside and even though i tried it all fell apart what it meant to me will eventually be a memory of a time when i tried so hard  i tried so hard and got so far but in the end it doesn't even matter i had to fall to lose it all but in the end it doesn't even matter  one thing i don't know why it doesn't even matter how hard you try keep that in mind i designed this rhyme to remind myself how i tried so hard in spite of the way you were mockin' me actin' like i was part of your property remembering all the times you fought with me i'm surprised it got so far things aren't the way they were before you wouldn't even recognize me anymore not that you knew me back then but it all comes back to me in the end you kept everything inside and even though i tried it all fell apart what it meant to me will eventually be a memory of a time when i tried so hard  i tried so hard and got so far but in the end it doesn't even matter i had to fall to lose it all but in the end it doesn't even matter  i've put my trust in you pushed as far as i can go for all this there's only one thing you should know i've put my trust in you pushed as far as i can go for all this there's only one thing you should know  i tried so hard and got so far but in the end it doesn't even matter i had to fall to lose it all but in the end it doesn't even matter

waiting in the weeds, eagles, it's coming on the end of august another summer's promise almost gone and though i heard some wise man say that every dog will have his day he never mentioned that these dog days get so long i don't know when i realized the dream was over well there was no particular hour no given day you know it didn't go down in flame there was no final scene no frozen frame i just watched it slowly fade away  and i've been waiting in the weeds waiting for my time to come around again and hope is floating on the breeze carrying my soul high up above the ground and i've been keeping to myself knowing that the seasons are slowly changing even though you're with somebody else he'll never love you like i do  i've been biding time with the crows and sparrows while peacocks prance and strut upon the stage if finding love is just a dance proximity and chance you will excuse me if i skip the masquerade  and i've been waiting in the weeds waiting for the dust to settle down along the back roads running through the fields lying on the outskirts of this lonesome town  and i imagine sunlight in your hair you're at the county fair you're holding hands and laughing and now the ferris-wheel has stopped you're swinging on the top suspended there with him and he's the darling of the chic the flavor of the week is melting down your pretty summer dress baby what a mess you're making   i've been stumbling through some dark places now i'm following the plow i know i've fallen out of your good graces it's alright now  and i've been waiting in the weeds waiting for the summer rain to fall upon the wild birds scattering the seeds answering the calling of the tide's eternal tune  the phases of the moon the chambers of the heart the egg and dart of small gray spiders spinning in the dark in spite of all the times the web is torn apart  and i've been waiting in the weeds waiting for the time to come around again and hope is floating on the breeze carrying my soul high up above the ground and i've been keeping to myself knowing that the seasons are slowly changing even though you're with somebody else he'll never love you like i do

the sad café, eagles, out in the shiny night the rain was softly falling tracks that ran down the boulevard had all been washed away out of the silver light the past came softly calling and i remember the times we spent inside the sad café oh it seemed like a holy place protected by amazing grace and we would sing right out loud the things we could not say we thought we could change this world with words like love and freedom we were part of the lonely crowd inside the sad café  oh expecting to fly we would meet on that beautiful shore in the sweet by and by  some of their dreams came true some just passed away and some of them stayed behind inside the sad café {acoustic solo}  the clouds rolled in and hid that shore now that glory train it don't stop here no more now i look at the years gone by and wonder at the powers that be i don't know why fortune smiles on some and let's the rest go free  maybe the time has drawn the faces i recall but things in this life change very slowly if they ever change at all no use in asking why it just turned out that way so meet me at midnight baby inside the sad café why don't you meet me at midnight baby inside the sad café {saxophone solo}
long road out of eden, eagles, moon shining down through the palms shadows moving on the sand somebody whispering the twenty-third psalm dusty rifle in his trembling hands somebody trying just to stay alive he got promises to keep over the ocean in america far away and fast asleep  silent stars blinking in the blackness of an endless sky cold silver satellites ghostly caravans passing by galaxies unfolding new worlds being born pilgrims and prodigals creeping toward the dawn  and it's a long road out of eden  music blasting from an suv on a bright and sunny day rolling down the interstate in the good old usa having lunch at the petroleum club smoking fine cigars and swapping lives he said give me another slice of that barbecued brisket! give me another piece of that pecan pie!  freeways flickering cell phones chiming a tune we're riding to utopia road map says we'll be arriving soon captains of the old order clinging to the reins assuring us these aches inside are only growing pains  but it's a long road out of eden  back home i was so certain the path was very clear but now i have to wonder what are we doing here? i'm not counting on tomorrow and i can't tell wrong from right but i'd give anything to be there in your arms tonight   weaving down the american highway through the litter and the wreckage and the cultural junk bloated with entitlement loaded on propaganda and now we're driving dazed and drunk been down the road to damascus the road to mandalay met the ghost of caesar on the appian way he said it's hard to stop this binging once you get a taste but the road to empire is a bloody stupid waste  behold the bitten apple the power of the tools but all the knowledge in the world is of no use to fools  and it's a long road out of eden

time, pink floyd, ticking away the moments that make up the dull day fritter and waste the hours in an offhand way kicking around on a piece of ground in your hometown waiting for someone or something to show you the way tired of lyin' in the sunshine stayin' home to watch the rain you are young an' life is long an' there is time to kill today an' then one day you find ten years have got behind you no one told you when to run you missed the startin' gun   and you run and you run to catch up with the sun but it's sinking racing around to come up behind you again the sun is the same in a relative way but you're older shorter of breath and one day closer to death every year is gettin' shorter never seem to find the time plans that either come to naught or half a page of scribbled lines hangin' on in quiet desperation is the english way the time is gone the song is over thought i'd somethin' more to say  home home again i like to be here when i can an' when i come home cold and tired it's good to warm my bones beside the fire far away across the field the tollin' of the iron bell calls the faithful to their knees to hear the softly spoken magic spells

us and them, pink floyd, us and them and after all we're only ordinary men me and you god only knows it's not what we would choose to do forward he cried from the rear and the front rank died and the general sat and the lines on the map moved from side to side  black and blue and who knows which is which and who is who up and down and in the end it's only round and round haven't you heard it's a battle of words? the poster bearer cried listen son said the man with the gun there's room for you inside  i mean they're not gonna kill ya so if you give 'em a quick short sharp shock they won't do it again dig it? i mean he get off lightly cause i would've given him a thrashing i only hit him once! it was only a difference of opinion but really i mean good manners don't cost nothing do they eh?  down and out it can't be helped but there's a lot of it about with without and who'll deny it's what the fighting's all about? out of the way it's a busy day i've got things on my mind for the want of the price of tea and a slice the old man died

echoes, pink floyd, overhead the albatross hangs motionless upon the air and deep beneath the rolling waves in labyrinths of coral caves the echo of a distant time comes willowing across the sand and everything is green and submarine  and no one showed us to the land and no one knows the where's or why's but something stirs and something tries starts to climb towards the light  strangers passing in the street by chance two separate glances meet and i am you and what i see is me and do i take you by the hand and lead you through the land and help me understand the best i can?  and no one calls us to move on and no one forces down our eyes no one speaks and no one tries no one flies around the sun   cloudless every day you fall upon my waking eyes inviting and inciting me to rise and through the window in the wall come streaming in on sunlight wings a million bright ambassadors of morning  and no one sings me lullabies and no one makes me close my eyes so i throw the windows wide and call to you across the sky

eclipse, pink floyd, all that you touch and all that you see all that you taste all you feel and all that you love and all that you hate all you distrust all you save and all that you give and all that you deal and all that you buy beg borrow or steal and all you create and all you destroy and all that you do and all that you say and all that you eat and everyone you meet and all that you slight and everyone you fight and all that is now and all that is gone and all that's to come and everything under the sun is in tune but the sun is eclipsed by the moon  (there is no dark side in the moon really matter of fact it's all dark)
dogs, pink floyd, you got to be crazy you gotta have a real need you gotta sleep on your toes and when you're on the street you got to be able to pick out the easy meat with your eyes closed and then moving in silently down wind and out of sight you gotta strike when the moment is right without thinking and after a while you can work on points for style like the club tie and the firm handshake a certain look in the eye and an easy smile you have to be trusted by the people that you lie to so that when they turn their backs on you you'll get the chance to put the knife in  you gotta keep one eye looking over your shoulder you know it's going to get harder and harder and harder as you get older yeah and in the end you'll pack up and fly down south hide your head in the sand just another sad old man all alone and dying of cancer  and when you lose control you'll reap the harvest you have sown and as the fear grows the bad blood slows and turns to stone and it's too late to lose the weight you used to need to throw around so have a good drown as you go down all alone dragged down by the stone  (stone stone stone...)  gotta admit that i'm a little bit confused sometimes it seems to me as if i'm just being used gotta stay awake gotta try and shake off this creeping malaise if i don't stand my own ground how can i find my way out of this maze deaf dumb and blind you just keep on pretending that everyone's expendable and no one has a real friend and it seems to you the thing to do would be to isolate the winner everything's done under the sun but you believe at heart everyone's a killer  who was born in a house full of pain who was trained not to spit in the fan who was told what to do by the man who was broken by trained personnel who was fitted with collar and chain who was given a pat on the back who was breaking away from the pack who was only a stranger at home who was ground down in the end who was found dead on the phone who was dragged down by the stone who was dragged down by the stone

high hopes, pink floyd, beyond the horizon of the place we lived when we were young in a world of magnets and miracles our thoughts strayed constantly and without boundary the ringing of the division bell had begun along the long road and on down the causeway do they still meet there by the cut there was a ragged band that followed in our footsteps running before time took our dreams away leaving the myriad small creatures trying to tie us to the ground to a life consumed by slow decay  the grass was greener the light was brighter with friends surrounded the nights of wonder  looking beyond the embers of bridges glowing behind us to a glimpse of how green it was on the other side steps taken forwards but sleepwalking back again dragged by the force of some inner tide at a higher altitude with flag unfurled we reached the dizzy heights of that dreamed of world   encumbered forever by desire and ambition there's a hunger still unsatisfied our weary eyes still stray to the horizon though down this road we've been so many times  the grass was greener the light was brighter the taste was sweeter the nights of wonder with friends surrounded the dawn mist glowing the water flowing the endless river for ever and ever   is that charlie? hello charlie! great...
