they said i rap like a robot so call me rap-bot  but for me to rap like a computer it must be in my genes i got a laptop in my back pocket my pen'll go off when i half-cock it got a fat knot from that rap profit made a livin' and a killin' off it ever since bill clinton was still in office with monica lewinsky feelin' on his nutsack i'm an mc still as honest but as rude and as indecent as all hell syllables skill-a-holic (kill 'em all with) this flippity dippity-hippity hip-hop you don't really wanna get into a pissin' match with this rappity brat packin' a mac in the back of the ac' backpack rap crap yap-yap yackety-yack and at the exact same time i attempt these lyrical acrobat stunts while i'm practicin' that i'll still be able to break a motherfuckin' table over the back of a couple of faggots and crack it in half only realized it was ironic i was signed to aftermath after the fact how could i not blow? all i do is drop f-bombs feel my wrath of attack rappers are havin' a rough time period here's a maxi pad it's actually disastrously bad for the wack while i'm masterfully constructing this masterpiece as  'cause i'm beginnin' to feel like a rap god rap god all my people from the front to the back nod back nod now who thinks their arms are long enough to slap box slap box? let me show you maintainin' this shit ain't that hard that hard  everybody wants the key and the secret to rap immortality like ι have got. well to be truthful the blueprint's simply rage and youthful exuberance everybody loves to root for a nuisance hit the earth like an asteroid did nothing but shoot for the moon since (pew!) mcs get taken to school with this music 'cause i use it as a vehicle to bus the rhyme now i lead a new school full of students me? i'm a product of rakim lakim shabazz 2pac n.w.a cube hey doc ren yella eazy thank you they got slim inspired enough to one day grow up blow up and be in a position to meet run–d.m.c. induct them into the motherfuckin' rock and roll hall of fame even though i'll walk in the church and burst in a ball of flames only hall of fame i'll be inducted in is the alcohol of fame on the wall of shame you fags think it's all a game 'til i walk a flock of flames off a plank and tell me what in the fuck are you thinkin'?

fuck being normal! and i just bought a new raygun from the future just to come and shoot ya like when fabolous made ray j mad 'cause fab said he looked like a fag at mayweather's pad singin' to a man while he played piano man oh man that was the 24/7 special on the cable channel so ray j went straight to the radio station the very next day hey fab i'ma kill you! lyrics comin' at you at supersonic speed (j.j. fad) uh summa-lumma dooma-lumma you assumin' i'm a human what i gotta do to get it through to you i'm superhuman? innovative and i'm made of rubber so that anything you say is ricochetin' off of me and it'll glue to you and i'm devastating more than ever demonstrating how to give a motherfuckin' audience a feeling like it's levitating never fading and i know the haters are forever waiting for the day that they can say i fell off they'll be celebrating 'cause i know the way to get 'em motivated i make elevating music you make elevator music oh he's too mainstream. well that's what they do when they get jealous they confuse it it's not hip-hop it's pop—'cause i found a hella way to fuse it with rock shock rap with doc throw on lose yourself and make 'em lose it i don't know how to make songs like that i don't know what words to use. let me know when it occurs to you while i'm rippin' any one of these verses that versus you it's curtains i'm inadvertently hurtin' you how many verses i gotta murder to prove that if you were half as nice your songs you could sacrifice virgins too? ugh school flunky pill junkie but look at the accolades these skills brung me full of myself but still hungry i bully myself 'cause i make me do what i put my mind to and i'm a million leagues above you ill when i speak in tongues but it's still tongue-in-cheek fuck you! i'm drunk so satan take the fucking wheel i'ma sleep in the front seat bumpin' heavy d and the boyz still chunky but funky but in my head there's something i can feel tugging and struggling angels fight with devils and here's what they want from me they're askin' me to eliminate some of the women hate but if you take into consideration the bitter hatred i have then you may be a little patient and more sympathetic to the situation and understand the discrimination but fuck it life's handin' you lemons? make lemonade then! but if i can't batter the women how the fuck am i supposed to bake them a cake then? don't mistake him for satan; it's a fatal mistake if you think i need to be overseas and take a vacation to trip a broad and make her fall on her face and don't be a retard! be a king?

'til the roof comes off 'til the lights go out 'til my legs give out can't shut my mouth 'til the smoke clears out am i high? perhaps i'ma rip this shit 'til my bones collapse (until the roof) 'til the roof comes off 'til the lights go out (the roof comes off) 'til my legs give out can't shut my mouth (until my legs) 'til the smoke clears out am i high? perhaps (give out from underneath me) i'ma rip this shit 'til my bones collapse  soon as a verse starts i eat at an mc's heart what is he thinking? how not to go against me smart and it's absurd how people hang on every word i'll prob'ly never get the props i feel i ever deserve but i'll never be served my spot is forever reserved if i ever leave earth that would be the death of me first ‘cause in my heart of hearts i know nothin' could ever be worse that's why i'm clever when i put together every verse my thoughts are sporadic i act like i'm an addict i rap like i'm addicted to smack like i'm kim mathers but i don't wanna go forth and back in constant battles the fact is i would rather sit back and bomb some rappers so this is like a full-blown attack i'm launchin' at 'em the track is on some battlin' raps who wants some static? ‘cause i don't really think that the fact that i'm slim matters a plaque and platinum status is whack if i'm not the baddest so  'til the roof comes off 'til the lights go out 'til my legs give out can't shut my mouth 'til the smoke clears out am i high? perhaps i'ma rip this shit 'til my bones collapse (until the roof) 'til the roof comes off 'til the lights go out (the roof comes off) 'til my legs give out can't shut my mouth (until my legs) 'til the smoke clears out am i high? perhaps (give out from underneath me) i'ma rip this shit 'til my bones collapse  until the roof (until the roof) the roof comes off (the roof comes off) until my legs (until my legs) give out from (underneath me) i will not fall i will stand tall feels like no one can beat me

guts over fear, eminem, feels like a close it's coming to fuck am i gonna do? it's too late to start over this is the only thing i thing i know  sometimes i feel like all i ever do is find different ways to word the same old song ever since i came along from the day the song called “hi! my name is” dropped started thinking my name was fault ‘cause any time things went wrong i was the one who they would blame it on the media made me the equivalent of a modern-day genghis khan tried to argue it was only entertainment dog gangster? nah courageous balls had to change my style they said i'm way too soft and i sound like az and nas out came the claws and the fangs been out since then but up until the instant that i went against it it was ingrained in me that i wouldn't amount to a shit stain i thought no wonder i had to unlearn everything my brain was taught do i really belong in this game? i pondered i just wanna play my part should i make waves or not? so back and forth in my brain the tug of war wages on and i don't wanna seem ungrateful or disrespect the art form i was raised upon but sometimes you gotta take a loss and have people rub it in your face before you get made pissed off and keep plugging it's your only outlet and your only outfit so you know they gonna talk about it better find a way to counter it quick and make it… ah feel like i've already said this a kabillion eighty times how many times can i say the same thing different ways that rhyme? what i really wanna say is if there's anyone else that can relate to my story bet you feel the same way i felt when i was in the same place you are when i was afraid to—  i was a… afraid to make a single sound afraid i would never find a way out out out afraid i'd never be found i didn't wanna go another round an angry man's power will shut you up trip wires fill this house with tip-toed love run out of excuses for everyone so here i am and i will not run  guts over fear the time is near guts over fear might shed a tear for all the times i let you push me round i let you keep me down now i got guts over fear guts over fear  feels like a close it's coming to fuck am i gonna do? it's too late to start over this is the only thing i thing i know  i know what it was like i was there once single parents hate your appearance as you struggle to find your place in this world and the pain spawns all the anger on but it wasn't 'til i put the pain in song learned who to aim it on that i made a spark started to spit harder shit learned how to harness it while the reins were off and there was a lot of bizarre shit but the crazy part was soon as i stopped saying i gave a fuck haters started to appreciate my art and it just breaks my heart to look at all the pain i caused but what am i gonna do when the rage is gone and the lights go out in that trailer park and the window is closing and there's nowhere else that i can go with flows and i'm frozen ‘cause there's no more emotion for me to pull from just a bunch of playful songs that i make for fun so to the break of dawn here i go recycling the same old song but i rather make “not afraid 2” than make another motherfucking “we made you” ah now i don't wanna seem indulgent when i discuss my lows and my highs my demise and my uprise pray to god i just open enough eyes later on and gave you the supplies and the tools to hopefully use that'll make you strong enough to lift yourself up when you feel like i felt ‘cause i can't explain to y'all how dang exhausted my legs felt just having to balance my dang self when on eggshells i was made to walk but thank you ma ‘cause that gave me the strength to cause shady-mania so when they empty that stadium least i made it out of that house and found a place in this world when the day was done so this is for every kid who all's they ever did was dreamt of one day just getting accepted i represent him or her anyone similar you are the reason that i made this song and everything you're scared to say don't be afraid to say no more from this day forward just let them a-holes talk take it with a grain of salt and eat their fucking faces off the legend of the angry blond lives on through you when i’m gone and to think i was a—  i was a… afraid to make a single sound afraid i would never find a way out out out afraid i'd never be found i didn't wanna go another round an angry man's power will shut you up trip wires fill this house with tip-toed love run out of excuses for everyone so here i am and i will not run  guts over fear the time is near guts over fear might shed a tear for all the times i let you push me round i let you keep me down now i got guts over fear guts over fear
space bound, eminem, we touch i feel a rush; we clutch it isn't much but it's enough to make me wonder what's in store for us it's lust it's torturous you must be a sorceress 'cause you just did the impossible: gained my trust don't play games it'll be dangerous if you fuck me over ‘cause if i get burnt i'ma show ya what it's like to hurt ‘cause i been treated like dirt before ya and love is evil — spell it backwards i'll show ya nobody knows me i'm cold walk down this road all alone it's no one's fault but my own it's the path i've chosen to go frozen as snow i show no emotion whatsoever so don't ask me why i have no love for these muh'fuckin' hoes bloodsuckin' succubuses what the fuck is up with this? i've tried in this department but i ain't had no luck with this it sucks but it's exactly what i thought it would be like tryin' to start over i got a hole in my heart but some kind of emotional roller coaster is something i won't go on so you toy with my emotions so it's over it's like an explosion every time i hold ya wasn't joking when i told ya you take my breath away you're a supernova and i'm a—  i'm a space-bound rocket ship and your heart's the moon and i'm aimin' right at you right at you 250000 miles on a clear night in june and i'm aimin' right at you right at you right at you  i'll do whatever it takes when i'm with you i get the shakes my body aches when i ain't with you i have zero strength there's no limit on how far i would go no boundaries no lengths why do we say that until we get that person that we think's gonna be that one? and then once we get 'em it's never the same you want 'em when they don't want you soon as they do feelings change it's not a contest and i ain't on no conquest for no mate i wasn't lookin' when i stumbled on to you musta been fate but so much is at stake what the fuck does it take? let's cut to the chase 'fore the door shuts in your face promise me if i cave in and break and leave myself open that i won't be makin' a mistake ‘cause i'm a—  i'm a space-bound rocket ship and your heart's the moon and i'm aimin' right at you right at you 250000 miles on a clear night in june and i'm aimin' right at you right at you right at you  so after a year and six months it's no longer me that you want but i love you so much it hurts never mistreated you once i poured my heart out to you let down my guard swear to god i blow my brains in your lap lay here and die in your arms drop to my knees and i'm pleadin' i'm tryna stop you from leavin' you won't even listen so fuck it i'm tryna stop you from breathin' i put both hands on your throat i sit on top of you squeezin' 'til i snap your neck like a popsicle stick ain't no possible reason i can think of to let you walk up out this house and let you live tears stream down both of my cheeks now i let you go and just give and 'fore i put that gun to my temple i told you this  and i would've done anything for you to show you how much i adored you but it's over now it's too late to save our love just promise me you'll think of me every time you look up in the sky and see a star ‘cause i'm a—  i'm a space-bound rocket ship and your heart's the moon and i'm aimin' right at you right at you 250000 miles on a clear night in june and i'm so lost without you without you without you
like toy soldiers, eminem, step by step heart to heart left right left we all fall down  step by step heart to heart left right left we all fall down like toy soldiers bit by bit torn apart we never win but the battle wages on for toy soldiers  i'm supposed to be the soldier who never blows his composure even though i hold the weight of the whole world on my shoulders i ain't never supposed to show it my crew ain't supposed to know it even if it means goin' toe-to-toe with a benzino it don't matter i never drag 'em in battles that i can't handle 'less i absolutely have to i'm supposed to set an example i need to be the leader my crew looks for me to guide 'em if some shit ever does pop off i'm supposed to be beside 'em that ja shit i tried to squash it it was too late to stop it there's a certain line you just don't cross and he crossed it i heard him say hailie's name on a song and i just lost it it was crazy the shit went way beyond some jay-z and nas shit and even though the battle was won i feel like we lost it i spent so much energy on it honestly i'm exhausted and i'm so caught in it that i almost feel i'm the one who caused it this ain't what i'm in hip-hop for that's not why i got in it that was never my object for someone to get killed why would i wanna destroy something i helped build? that wasn't my intentions my intentions were good i went through my whole career without ever mentionin' **** and that was just outta respect for not runnin' my mouth and talkin' about somethin' that i knew nothin' about plus dre told me stay out this just wasn't my beef so i did i just fell back watched and gritted my teeth while he's all over tv down-talkin' the man who literally saved my life like fuck it i understand this is business and this shit just isn't none of my business but still knowin' the shit could pop off at any minute ‘cause—  step by step heart to heart left right left we all fall down like toy soldiers bit by bit torn apart we never win but the battle wages on for toy soldiers  there used to be a time when you could just say a rhyme and wouldn't have to worry about one of your people dyin' but now it's elevated ‘cause once you put someone's kids in it the shit gets escalated — it ain't just words no more is it? it's a different ballgame you call names and you ain't just rappin' we actually tried to stop the 50 and ja beef from happenin' me and dre had sat with him kicked it and had a chat with him and asked him not to start it he wasn't gonna go after him until ja started yappin' in magazines how he stabbed him fuck it 50 smash him! mash on him let him have it meanwhile my attention's pulled in another direction some receptionist at the source who answers phones at his desk has an erection for me and thinks that i'll be his resurrection tries to blow the dust off his mic and make a new record but now he's fucked the game up 'cause one of the ways i came up was through that publication the same one that made me famous now the owner of it has got a grudge against me for nothin'? well fuck it that motherfucker could get it too fuck him then! but i'm so busy bein' pissed off i don't stop to think that we just inherited 50's beef with murder inc. and he's inherited mine which is fine ain't like either of us mind but we still have soldiers that's on the front line who's willin' to die for us as soon as we give the orders never to extort us strictly to show they support us and maybe shout 'em out in a rap or up in a chorus to show 'em we love 'em back and let 'em know how important it is to have runyon avenue soldiers up in our corners their loyalty to us is worth more than any award is but i ain't tryna have none of my people hurt or murdered it ain't worth it i can't think of a perfecter way to word it than to just say that i love y'all too much to see the verdict i'll walk away from it all 'fore i let it go any further but don't get it twisted it's not a plea that i'm coppin' i'm just willin' to be the bigger man if y'all can quit poppin' off at the jaws well then i can ‘cause frankly i'm sick of talkin' i'm not gonna let someone else's coffin rest on my conscience ‘cause—  step by step heart to heart left right left we all fall down like toy soldiers bit by bit torn apart we never win but the battle wages on for toy soldiers

dear mama, 2pac, you are appreciated when i was young me and my mama had beef seventeen years old kicked out on the streets though back at the time i never thought i'd see her face ain't a woman alive that could take my mama's place suspended from school and scared to go home i was a fool with the big boys breakin' all the rules i shed tears with my baby sister over the years we was poorer than the other little kids and even though we had different daddies the same drama when things went wrong we'd blame mama i reminisce on the stress i caused it was hell huggin' on my mama from a jail cell and who'd think in elementary hey i'd see the penitentiary one day? and runnin' from the police that's right mama catch me put a whoopin' to my backside and even as a crack fiend mama you always was a black queen mama i finally understand for a woman it ain't easy tryin' to raise a man you always was committed a poor single mother on welfare tell me how you did it there's no way i can pay you back but the plan is to show you that i understand: you are appreciated  lady don't you know we love ya? (dear mama) sweet lady place no one above ya (you are appreciated) sweet lady don't you know we love ya?  now ain't nobody tell us it was fair no love from my daddy ‘cause the coward wasn't there he passed away and i didn't cry ‘cause my anger wouldn't let me feel for a stranger they say i'm wrong and i'm heartless but all along i was lookin' for a father he was gone i hung around with the thugs and even though they sold drugs they showed a young brother love i moved out and started really hangin' i needed money of my own so i started slangin' i ain't guilty ‘cause even though i sell rocks it feels good puttin' money in your mailbox i love payin' rent when the rent is due i hope you got the diamond necklace that i sent to you ‘cause when i was low you was there for me and never left me alone because you cared for me and i could see you comin' home after work late you're in the kitchen tryin' to fix us a hot plate you just workin' with the scraps you was given and mama made miracles every thanksgivin' but now the road got rough you're alone you're tryin' to raise two bad kids on your own and there's no way i can pay you back but my plan is to show you that i understand: you are appreciated  lady don't you know we love ya? (dear mama) sweet lady place no one above ya (you are appreciated) sweet lady don't you know we love ya?  pour out some liquor and i reminisce ‘cause through the drama i can always depend on my mama and when it seems that i'm hopeless you say the words that can get me back in focus when i was sick as a little kid to keep me happy there's no limit to the things you did and all my childhood memories are full of all the sweet things you did for me and even though i act crazy i gotta thank the lord that you made me there are no words that can express how i feel you never kept a secret always stayed real and i appreciate how you raised me and all the extra love that you gave me i wish i could take the pain away if you can make it through the night there's a brighter day everything will be alright if you hold on it's a struggle every day gotta roll on and there's no way i can pay you back but my plan is to show you that i understand: you are appreciated  lady don't you know we love ya?

bomb first (my second reply), 2pac, in today's music news: the ever-controversial 2pac shakur has just released another album under the alias makaveli. music insiders are running wild trying to rearrange other artists' street dates in fear of a wipeout in retail inter-chart movement. although no one knows the exact cause of the new album resources tell me a number of less fortunate rappers have joined together in conspiracy to assassinate the character of not only mr shakur but of death row records as well. nas the alleged ring leader is furious at 2pac's – excuse me – makaveli's verbal assault on mobb sleep notorious p.i.g. and several other new york rappers. jay-z from hawaiian sophie fame big little whatever and several other corny-sounding motherfuckers are understandably shaken up by this release. the question everybody wants to know is: why'd they get this nigga started? 2pac – rather makaveli – was not available for comment but released this statement:  it's not about east or west it's about niggas and bitches power and money ridaz and punks which side are you on? *heartbeat* *gunshots* *encroaching footsteps* these niggas is still fuckin' talkin'?
